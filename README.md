The problem: 

    After the removal of the dislike button, creators have struggled with determining how well their youtube videos are performing. 
Our solution: 

    Provide users with a platform to input their channels and obtain feedback regarding the overall reaction of users sentimentally 
    via their comments using machine learning. 
How did we do it: 

    Using the streamlit framework, we were able to easily code the front end of this project and thus were able to put our 
    effort into properly implementing google cloud database services. This includes data storage, youtube api, and natural 
    language processing. 
What went well?

    After a lot of brain storming, we committed on the idea of this youtube video analyzer and stuck with it until we finally 
    hit a breakthrough. We were able to communicate and work through problems gradually but steadil, allowing us to eventually 
    get the project moving.
What went wrong?

    Getting started was difficult. All of us were super unfamiliar with the topics and struggled to even come up with ideas. 
    At one point we were frustrated and almost ready to throw in the towel.
